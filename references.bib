Yet there is no precise definition of, and there is a paucity of research on, this construct. Based on what has been theorized about perfectionism, a multidimensional measure was developed and several hypotheses regarding the nature of perfectionism were tested in four separate studies. The major dimension of this measure was excessive concern over making mistakes. Five other dimensions were identified, including high personal standards, the perception of high parental expectations, the perception of high parental criticism, the doubting of the quality of one’s actions, and a preference for order and organization. Perfectionism and certain of its subscales were correlated with a wide variety of psychopathological symptoms. There was also an association between perfectionism and procrastination. Several subscales of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), personal standards and organization, were associated with positive achievement striving and work habits. The MPS was highly correlated with one of the existing measures of perfectionism. Two other existing measures were only moderately correlated with the MPS and with each other. Future studies of perfectionism should take into account the multidimensional nature of the construct.}, number={5}, journal={Cognitive Therapy and Research}, author={Frost, Randy O. and Marten, Patricia and Lahart, Cathleen and Rosenblate, Robin}, year={1990}, month={Oct}, pages={449–468}, language={en} }

This research examined the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), a 45-item measure of self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism. Study 1 provided normative data for various patient groups and demonstrated the stability of the MPS subscales in psychiatric patients. Study 2 showed that the MPS subscales have adequate concurrent validity, are not influenced by response biases, and that the items require a Grade 6–7 reading level. Overall, the MPS appears to be a useful measure for individuals with various clinical disorders.

 @article{Slaney_Mobley_Trippi_Ashby_Johnson_1996, title={Almost Perfect Scale—Revised}, DOI={10.1037/t02161-000}, abstractNote={The Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney et al, 1996) is a revision of the Almost Perfect Scale (APS; Slaney & Johnson, 1992). The APS-R was developed to orthogonally measure the adaptive and maladaptive aspects of perfectionism. Two qualitative studies (Slaney and Ashby, 1996; Slaney, Chadha, Mobley, and Kennedy, 2006) provided guidance in differentiating adaptive from maladaptive perfectionism. The APS-R is composed of 23 items that are responded to on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). The APS-R consists of three subscales: High Standards (7 items), Order (4 items), and Discrepancy (12 items). A series of studies by Slaney and his associates support the reliability and validity of the APS-R. Internal consistency coefficients for the APS-R ranged from .85 to .92 (Slaney et al., 2001). Concurrent validity of the APS-R has been demonstrated through significant positive correlations with other measures of perfectionism and through expected correlations with theoretically related constructs (Ashby & Rice, 2002; Slaney et al., 2001; Suddarth & Slaney, 2001). Internal consistency coefficients for the APS-R for the present study (N = 279 undergraduate students) were .86 for High Standards, .88 for Order, and .95 for Discrepancy.

The present study investigated the possibility of distinguishing aspects of perfectionism on the basis of perceived consequences, mirroring a behavioural distinction between positive and negative reinforcement. A 40-item questionnaire, designed to measure perfectionism defined in terms of both positive and negative outcome, was administered to 281 women; a comparison group (N = 225), an eating disordered group (N = 21), a depressed group (N = 15) and successful athletes (N = 20). A factor analysis of the results extracted three factors; negative perfectionism including both personal and social items; positive personal perfectionism; and positive social perfectionism. Limiting the number of factors to two yielded a clear distinction between positive and negative perfectionism. Group comparisons yielded significance differences; for athletes high positive perfectionism was associated with a low negative perfectionism score; for the eating disorders group a high positive perfectionism score was associated with a high negative score. When analysed in terms of personal and social items the distinguishing factors were the negative and positive components, athletes and eating disordered groups obtaining comparably high positive personal perfectionism scores and the clinical groups obtaining comparably high negative perfectionism scores.}, number={5}, journal={Personality and Individual Differences}, author={Terry-Short, L.
