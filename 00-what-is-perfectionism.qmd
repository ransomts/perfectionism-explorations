# Why perfectionism is important to study in education research

# Why we care about online communities in education research

Online communities are a place that individuals go to vent frustrations. Specific communities can be oriented towards a particular group such as engineering students. Reddit has a community intended for engineering students (r/EngineeringStudents) that has a large backlog of student experiences in text form. Shared experiences outlined on this community can indicate the struggles engineering students have faced and we should be aware of. 

Additionally, online communities act as repositories of questions and answers that students may find if they search the internet for solutions to their problems. Knowing about trends in the answers provided to engineering students online helps educators know what students may have already tried.
